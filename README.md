# NFL-Team-Logos-Transparent-Squared
NFL Team Logos squared for easy table graphics and resizing. 
I compiled this because the transparent team logos from wikipedia all have different aspect ratios, and as such can be difficult to resize to fit correctly.
The included csv compiles the NFLVerse team abbreviations along with links to all the logos.

To load all the logo links in an R data frame, simply: 
```R
logos <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shoenot/NFL-Team-Logos-Transparent-Squared/refs/heads/main/logo_urls.csv")
```
Have fun!
